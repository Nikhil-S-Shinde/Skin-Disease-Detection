# Skin-Disease-Detection

Deep Learning prooject that combines the strenghts of DenseNet121 and InceptionV2 to classify skin diseases
This combination of models was decided after training the dataset on five transfer learning models:
 - Resnet50
 - DenseNet121
 - Inception
 - Xception
 - VGG16

The dataset contains around 4000 images belonging to 31 classes
The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AiDVpgy-o4ZLKXZ_yqnWWEHFYhCbrfP1
